# Missed Movies

A full stack React/Node.js application to keep track of all those movies you've been meaning to watch or want to save for later. This project was built with React/TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL (Supabase), and RESTful API architecture.

## Overview

With full CRUD capabilities built with RESTful architecture and a PostgreSQL database on Supabase, users can search, add, edit, delete, and view movies. They can organize movies into categories, which they can customize. Users can search for movies and scroll through top movie lists via the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API.

Project provides full authentication: users can sign up and create a password. Sign up and verify via email from Supabase then sign in for full access.
